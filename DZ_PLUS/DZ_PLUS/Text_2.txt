Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology security cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. These costs include the expenses of discovering and responding to the breach, the cost of downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand. Cybercriminals target customers personally identifiable information names, addresses, national identification numbers and credit card information â€” and then sell these records in underground digital marketplaces. Compromised often leads to a loss of customer trust, the imposition of regulatory fines, and even legal action.Security system complexity created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy governed by best practices and automated using advanced analytics artificial intelligence and machine learning, can fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.
